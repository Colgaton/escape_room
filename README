Simple python script to act when certain buttons of a USB joystick is pressed. I wrote it for a "escape room" like play I build.

The player has to guess the right presses order. Another code will just shutdown the machine (I was running in in a raspiberry pi). In Raspbian I just call it from /etc/rc.local to run the script on boot (as root so it has permissions to shutdown the equipment).

You will need to adjust the path for your joystick and set the right scancodes from it for each button.
